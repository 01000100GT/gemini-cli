# FileOperations Mega Tool for Gemini CLI - Task Breakdown

## General Development Guidance

### **Core Principles**
- **Use TypeScript:** Implement all components using TypeScript following Gemini CLI conventions
- **Monorepo Structure:** Work within the Gemini CLI workspace structure (packages/core/src/tools/)
- **Test-Driven Development:** Write tests using Vitest before implementing each task
- **Build and Test:** Use `npm run build` and `npm test` commands from the root directory

### **Post-Task Checklist**
1. Update `fileoperations_arch.md` if any architectural changes were made
2. Mark the task as complete in `fileoperations_tasks.md`
3. Document implementation notes and architectural decisions in `fileoperations_tasks.md`
4. Update remaining tasks if architecture changes affected dependencies
5. Ensure `npm run build` and `npm test` run successfully with no warnings from root directory
6. Run `npm run lint` from root directory and fix any issues
7. Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure TypeScript compilation
8. Commit changes with descriptive commit message following conventional commits
9. Push to the fileoperations_mega_tool branch
10. Don't include Claude as an author or coauthor

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **Error Handling:** Follow Gemini CLI patterns using `getErrorMessage()` and `isNodeError()` utilities
- **Concurrency:** Use async/await patterns, AbortSignal for cancellation, follow CoreToolScheduler patterns
- **Testing:** Vitest with comprehensive test suites, >80% coverage, use existing test utilities
- **Documentation:** JSDoc/TSDoc comments for all public APIs following Gemini CLI style
- **Naming:** Follow Gemini CLI conventions (PascalCase for types/classes, camelCase for functions/variables)
- **File Organization:** Follow existing tool structure (tool class, tests, types in separate files)

## Development Workflow

For each task listed below, the following process must be followed upon completion:

1.  **Mark Task as Complete:** Update the status of the task in this file from `[ ]` to `[x]`.
2.  **Add Notes:** Add a "Notes" section under the completed task. Document any challenges, decisions made, or interesting outcomes.
3.  **Assess Architectural Impact:**
    *   If the implementation required a deviation from the `fileoperations_arch.md`, add an "Architecture Change" section under the task notes.
    *   Immediately update the `fileoperations_arch.md` to reflect the new reality.
    *   Review all subsequent tasks in this plan and update them if they are affected by the change.
4.  **Commit Changes:** Use `git add .` and `git commit` to save the work. The commit message should be clear and reference the completed task, for example: `feat: Complete Task 2 - Core Data Structures`.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance Regression**: Mitigate with comprehensive benchmarks and performance tests
2. **Memory Leaks**: Use pprof and continuous profiling
3. **Concurrency Bugs**: Extensive use of race detector and stress tests
4. **Language Support Complexity**: Start with Go, add others incrementally

### Project Risks

2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain adapters throughout migration
3. **Adoption Resistance**: Provide clear migration benefits and tooling

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: 10x improvement in multi-file operations vs sequential tool calls
2. **Reliability**: Match or exceed existing tool success rates (99.9%)
3. **Adoption**: 80% of Gemini CLI power users adopting within 3 months
4. **Developer Satisfaction**: Reduced LLM round trips by 75% or more
5. **Compatibility**: 100% backward compatibility with existing workflows
6. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Gemini CLI features
