I would like to build an alternative UI for this CLI that presents itself as a VS Code extension.  I will describe how I am thinking about it and I would like you to evaluate this approach and suggest alternatives, if necessary.                                                                                                 │

We can create a VSCode extension in typescript, by importing the core package and then building conversational functionality similar to what is provided by the cli package.  I am thinking that the most flexible way to achieve that is to build this conversational functionality in a VS Code webview, probably using React, similar to how the CLI interface is constructed (probably best to keep them closely aligned).

Before we do that, we should assess the architectural decomposition between CLI and core and ensure that it is well factored.  One of the reasons for doing so is that eventually we might want to move the functionality provided by core into a separate process where the same process can be interacted with both from the IDE and from a CLI.

Before we refactor, we should ensure that we have sufficient unit and functional test coverage of all of the important functionality so that we can confirm that nothing broke during refactoring.  The existing test suite is comprehensive, but we should evaluate if there’s any room for improvement.

As we proceed with this project, we will ensure that we use checkpointing to preserve our progress in case we have to backtrack.

Also, as we refactor, let’s try to minimize the changes when we can.  It’s really important to achieve the end goal without creating a huge disturbance in the code base at this point.  Additive changes (like writing the new extension code in a separate package) are ok.

Let’s start by creating a detailed project plan and saving it to a file so that we can preserve it.
