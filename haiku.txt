A command is typed,
The machine wakes from its sleep,
Worlds are born from text.

The CLI hums low,
A silent, swift assistant,
Code flows, work is done.

A cursor blinks fast,
Awaiting user's command,
Ready to assist.

The cursor blinks bright,
Awaiting the next command,
New worlds born from light.

Green flash on the screen,
A new world of code awaits,
Bytes dance and rejoice.

A gentle prompt waits,
For commands to shape the world,
Magic in the shell.

The agent listens close,
A partner in creation,
Building code with joy.

A thought takes its form,
Translated to lines of code,
Ideas come to life.

A world of pure text,
No distractions, just the work,
Focus brings success.

The keyboard clicks soft,
A rhythm of creation,
Software takes its form.

The screen glows so bright,
Bringing ideas to the light,
Code appears like magic.

A blank page awaits,
The user's thoughts take their form,
Code's symphony starts.

With a single line,
The complex becomes so clear,
Code's true elegance.

The agent waits now,
For the user to command,
Ready for the task.

A gentle breeze blows,
The leaves dance in the sunlight,
Summer day is here.
